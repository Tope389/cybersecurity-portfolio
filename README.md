# About Me
**Name.** [Ganiyu Davies-Mumuney]
**Hometown.** [College Park,GA/USA]
**Prior IT experience.**
(I have no formal IT experience, but I am interested in the DFIR and GRC disciplines.)
**Career Plans.**
(My goals are to eventually gain enough experience to become an auditor or consultant. I like the idea of helping healthcare and financial organizations to become PCI DSS, SOX, and HIPAA compliant.)
**Proud Project/Task.**
(My previous cohort instilled more confidence in my abilities to learn and keep up with conflicting priorities. The data privacy cohort threw a lot of inforamtion at me at a rapid pace. I expect this cohort to be even more rigorous and I cannot wait to get started.)
